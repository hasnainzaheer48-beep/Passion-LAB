            To me, art is the ultimate form of human connection, a bridge between the internal landscape of my mind
            and
            the
            external world. This bond began as a childhood obsession with drawing, a time when my hands were
            constantly iching to make something and every blank surface was an invitation to create. I grew up
            mesmerized by shows like M.A.D. on
            Pogo,
            where watching the magic of DIY creation made me realize that art wasn't just something you looked at,it
            was
            something you built with your own two hands. Those episodes were my first real masterclasses, sparking a
            lifelong
            habit of sketching that has never truly left me. I see art as a restless dialogue between the creator
            and
            the
            observer, a space where the intangible finally takes shape. Whether through a bold line or a delicate
            detail, art
            allows me to speak when words feel insufficient, offering a sanctuary for the imagination.<br>

            I love to draw whenever I get the chance, wether it be during lecture or exam. You will find more
            drawings than actual study material on my notes if you ever happen to look at my register.
            I like to draw stylized characters and then I try to bend a story around them. <br>
            This is one hobby in which I have truly invested my time and focus in. Nothing can replace the feeling
            of filling a blank page with Storkes of pens.
